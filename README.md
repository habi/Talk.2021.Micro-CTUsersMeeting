# 20210902_ToScA

My talk at the conference of the 'Tomography for Scientific Advancement society' (ToScA UK & Europe 2021](https://www.toscainternational.org/2021-ukeu)) on September 1, 2021.

We are talking about [the tooth analysis method](https://habi.github.io/zmk-tooth-cohort-method-manuscript/) and present what we did there.

Since I've told the story about the teeth before (in an internal seminar at the Institute of Anatomy), I just copied the repository of [said talk](https://github.com/habi/Talk.2020.AnatomyInternalSeminar) and updated from there.
