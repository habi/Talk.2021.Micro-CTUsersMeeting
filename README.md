# 20211012_BrukerUserMeeting

My talk at the [Bruker microCT User Meeting 2021](https://www.bruker.com/en/news-and-events/events/microCT_user_meeting_2021.html) on October 12, 2021.

We are talking about [the tooth analysis method](https://habi.github.io/zmk-tooth-cohort-method-manuscript/) and present what we did there.

I've told the story about the teeth before (in an internal seminar at the Institute of Anatomy and at [ToScA 2021](https://github.com/habi/Talk.2021.ToScA), I just copied the repository of [said talk](https://github.com/habi/Talk.2021.ToScA) and mainly just updated from there.
